Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm an assistant professor of software engineering at [Jordan University of Science and Technology](https://www.just.edu.jo/). I received my Ph.D. in software engineering from [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu).

My main research interests include cybersecurity, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.

In addition to my research, I'm also dedicated to teaching and mentoring students. I teach courses in the area of [software engineering and programming](/_pages/teaching.md) and supervised many undergraduate and graduate students in their projects.
