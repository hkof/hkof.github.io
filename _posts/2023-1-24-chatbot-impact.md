In recent years, there has been a growing trend among young IT students to use chatbots like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) to solve their homework assignments specially in introductory programming courses. While it may seem like a quick and easy way to get the answers they need, this practice can be detrimental to their learning process.

One major issue with using chatbots to solve homework assignments is that it takes away the opportunity for students to practice their problem-solving skills. Instead of trying different approaches and figuring out how to solve the problem independently, they can simply input their question into the chatbot and receive the answer without any effort. This can lead to a lack of understanding and ability to apply their knowledge in real-world situations.

Another problem with using chatbots to solve homework assignments is that it can lead to a lack of creativity and innovation. When students are given the answers without thinking for themselves, they may be unable to develop new and unique solutions to problems. This can limit their potential and hinder their growth as IT professionals.

One way to combat this problem is to ensure students understand the importance of learning through trial and error. By encouraging them to experiment and take risks, they will be more likely to develop their problem-solving skills and come up with creative solutions. Another solution is to ensure homework assignments are designed in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to use chatbots to solve them. For example, assignments could include open-ended questions or require students to develop original solutions.

In conclusion, using chatbots like ChatGPT to solve homework assignments can negatively impact the learning process of IT students. It takes away the opportunity for students to practice their problem-solving skills, limits their creativity and innovation, and hinders their growth as IT professionals. To combat this problem, it is essential to encourage students to learn through trial and error and to design homework assignments that chatbots cannot solve.
